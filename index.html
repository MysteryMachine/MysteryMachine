                        Hey, I'm Sal Becker, a Brazilian born programmer and artist. I primarily work on games and
                        fullstack web apps. When I work on games, I collaborate with comics artist
                        <a href="http://www.kjmartinet.com"> KJ Martinet </a> to make art games that explore the dynamic
                        between play and art. I'm primarily a Clojure and Javascript developer. I'm experienced
                        in working with functional paradigms in backend development, frontend development, and
                        game development. I also enjoy mathematics and more pure computer science. I am
                        part of the Recurse Center's Fall II class of 2015.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, I am a human rights advocate. I believe deeply in intersectionality,
                        and in doing more than just talk when it comes to fighting oppression. I believe tech
                        is doing a terrible job at training and retaining all sorts of talented people.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When I am relaxing, I like playing games, weightlifting, watching Twitch.tv, watching movies and shows,
                        hanging out with the <a href="http://www.isthereamodcabal.com">Mod Cabals</a>, reading comics, drinking, and
                        dancing.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    Kushana is a data driven, functional game engine authored in Clojure and Clojurescript.
                    It is intended to be used for lo-fi 3d games, and for protyping networked games.
                    In Kushana, you describe scenes as simple data, and then define middlewares that
                    transform this data. Kushana then allows you to run that code both on the server and
                    client sides.

                    Worked with KJ Martinet to produce a short indie horror game for her art show, <em>Abandoned Places, Forgotten Spaces</em>.
                    In the game, you wander around a forest finding the phantoms of dead animals as you hunt for food.
                    It uses gameplay to explore the sudden and pervasive realities of death in nature.
                    The game is in Unity, Arcadia, and Clojure.

                <p>
                    Programmed a silly shoot 'em up game using Unity, Arcadia, and Clojure for an art show,
                    <em>She Blinded Me With Science: Women in Science Fiction</em>. The game was presented at the show
                    where people could play it live. The game was not released to the public, because it was more
                    of an educational endeavor for the team, and not meant to receive the sort of polish that
                    would warrant a public release.

	                  A simple JS app that implements some stuff I learned while
	                  taking a Coursera course on Automata theory. It uses a syntax
	                  free grammar to generate random X-Files episodes. Was a
	                  submission for KJ Martinet's X-Files themed art show.

	                  Skull Beggar was built using Ruby on Rails, Angular.js,
	                  and Heroku (if you're visiting this app, give Heroku a
	                  second to spin up). It's a cute
	                  little app that lets you bet on The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
	                  runs. It's got a bunch of nifty features, and was built to be
	                  relatively mobile friendly.
