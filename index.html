				<p> 
					Hello, I'm Sal, also known as Mystery, and this is my webzone.
					This spot is the very spot where I keep all of my internet shit.
					I'm an originally-from-Brazil, now based in Newark, NJ &amp; Brooklyn, NY
					based programmer, artist, and games maker. In my spare time, I
					enjoy actually playing video games and board games, 
					watching streams on twitch.tv, eating food, petting cute animals, 
					<a href="http://isthereamodcabal.com">not being in a mod cabal</a>,
					and enjoying TV, music, and movies. I'm happily employed as a junior 
					full stack developer at Priori Legal.
				</p>
				
				<h2> As a Programmer </h2>
				
				<p>
					I'm a programming languages nerd. Currently, I'm interested in
					functional programming languages, like Clojure/script, Haskell, Elm,
					and F#, and Rust (which is not quite functional, but has a lot of)
					very excellent language design inspired by functional languages. I also
					like to code in Javascript, Ruby, and C. The tech I'm currently working
					with include Ruby on Rails, Angular.js, Heroku, Git/hub professionally,
					and Arcadia, Unity, React.js, Om, Flux/us on the hobby side. Currently
					I'm exploring the applying Rich Hickey's "Easy is not Simple" speech
					to game development. Game dev tools cater to rich studios that can
					handle complexity in exchange for performance, or to non-technically
					oriented individuals, who need an easy programming environment. I
					believe game development tools that aim to reduce the complexities
					of development would be a great boon to the indie scene, and would
					spur the growth of new and interesting gameplay mechanics.
				</p>
				
				<h2> As an Artist </h2>
				
				<p>
					I'm more of a programmer than an artist, but I've worked on a few
					art projects. The majority of my art work is game-oriented. I'm a
					huge proponent of utilizing gameplay to create art in game&emdash;hence
					my interest in providing simple, powerful tools to small time indies.
					Largely, I've only had the chance to work on small practice games, but
					I'm working with a team to possibly produce something cool by the end
					of 2015.

				<h2> Projects </h2>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://sisyphus.rocks/skull-beggar/"> Skull Beggar</a>
						<p> 
							Skull Beggar was built using Ruby on Rails, Angular.js,
							and Heroku (if you're visiting this app, give Heroku a
							second to spin up). It's a cute
							little app that lets you bet on The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth
							runs. It's got a bunch of nifty features, and was built to be
							relatively mobile friendly.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://sisyphus.rocks/apps/monster-of-the-week/"> Monster of the Week </a>
						<p> 
							A simple JS app that implements some stuff I learned while
							taking a Coursera course on Automata theory. It uses a syntax
							free grammar to generate random X-Files episodes. Was a 
							submission for KJ Martinet's X-Files themed art show.
