                        I created this talk as an introductory slideshow, and as an example
                        to my jobim library. It goes over my motivations for creating
                        the library, and over some of the basics of jobim.

                        This is a humorous talk going over some of the basics of macros
                        in a homoiconic language like LISP. It includes motivations and
                        the benefits of a macro system in a language where code is data.

                        This talk attempts to show off some of Clojure's tools for
                        polymorphism, and examines how some of these tools can
                        help a user avoid the expression problem by taking advantage
                        of Clojure generic programming approach.

                        This talk is an introduction to some of Clojure's basic features,
                        and to the philosphy of the language. It goes over the
                        functional and data driven approach that the language employs.

                        beginners to functional languages to get acquainted with some
                        of the most basic building blocks of functional programming.
