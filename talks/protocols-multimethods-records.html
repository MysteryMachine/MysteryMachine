# Records, Protocols, Multimethods

# Motivation

It is a commonly pattern in programning to want to alter a functions behavior
based on the arguments passed to it. In Clojure, the simplest way to achieve
that is to use a `case` statement.

```clojure
(defn foo [a b]
  (case a
    :bar {:a b}
    :baz {:b :a}))
```

What this method has in simplicity, it loses in extensibility. What if users
want to take part of your abstraction and extend it for their own data structures
and use cases. Furthermore, what if you need something like this?

```clojure
(defn boop [a]
  (case (type a)
    ...))
```

This is especially messy, and any explicit runtime type check is prone to bugs,
overcoupling, and generally a bad time for everyone involved.

# Records

Records are like Clojure hashmaps with type metadata associated with them.
Records can implement Protocols, and they also have a set number of fields that
they always required.

```clojure
(defrecord Dog [bark breed])
(Dog. "woof" "Corgi")
(map->Dog {:bark "woof", :breed "Corgi"})
```

To work with records, just think of them as normal hashmaps. All functions that work
on vanilla Clojure hashmaps work on a record.

# Protocols, Solving Type Dispatch

```clojure
(defprotocol Runnable (run [this]))

(defrecord Runner [legs]
  Runnable
  (run [this] (move (:legs this))))

(defrecord Program [code])
(extend-type Program
  Runnable
  (run [this] (execute (:code this))))

(run (Program. "(+ 1 2)"))
(run (Runner. [:leg1 :leg2 :leg3]))
```

Protocols provide functions in a namespace. You can call that function on any
record or types that implements that Protocol. To implement the Protocol,
a Record must implement every function defined in the Protocol, with the
same function signature. A Protocol can define multiple functions. Every function
must take one argument, a this, which is the object whose type we are dispatching on.
Additional arguments can also be provided. Protocols can be implemented on or after the
time the record is defined.

# Multimethods, Beyond Type Dispatch

```clojure
(defmulti  fizzbuzz
  (fn [n]
    [(zero? (rem n 3)) (zero? (rem n 5))]))
(defmethod fizzbuzz [true  true]  [n] "Fizzbuzz")
(defmethod fizzbuzz [true  false] [n] "Fizz")
(defmethod fizzbuzz [false true]  [n] "Buzz")
(defmethod fizzbuzz [false false] [n] n)
(map fizzbuzz (range 1 100))

```

Multimethods are defined with a function that is applied to its arguments. The multimethod
takes the value returned by that function and selects a defmethod whose value is equal to
the return value. To get type dispatch similar to protocols, you'd maybe write
`(defmulti fizzbuzz #(type %1))` to dispatch on the type of the first argument.

Multimethods are more powerful than protocols, but they are also slightly slower. If you
are dispatching on type, consider using a protocol instead.

# When To Use What?

Use pure data if you can. If a hashmap will do, use the hashmap.

Use a record and protocols
if you find yourself inserting lots of functions into a hashmap. If you ever write this
((:my-fn this) this), stop yourself, write a protocol and a record, and use that instead.
A one off protocol is better than just polluting your data with lots of functions. Simple
data is easier to work with, is easier to serialize.

Use records if after profiling, you realized you lose a lot of speed creating the same hashmaps.
Record creation is faster than hashmap creation, so if you're creating thousands of a 3 field
hashmap, a record might serve you better.

Use records if you need to change behavior based on types. If you are changing behavior
based on something a little more complex than types, use multimethods instead.

# Cont...

Use multimethods if your objects change behavior based on some sort of grouping. Your objects
might all be different, but behaviorly they can be caterogized based on some sort of shared
property.

Use multimethods and protocols over a `cond` or `case` if you would like your users to be
able to participate in your abstraction. If your worldview is not exhaustive, then a
multimethod and protocol may allow for your abstraction to be more useful.

# Dojo: LISPmon

Let's implement a small game in Reagent where we can play Pokemon. In it, we'll use all
three concepts that we learned in this talk, plus some Reagent basics!
