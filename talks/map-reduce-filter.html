# Map, Reduce, and Filter: Higher Order Functions for Data Analysis.

By Sal Becker for the Recurse Center

slides @ sisyphus.rocks/talks/map-reduce-filter

---

# Motivation

We'll be using these three higher order functions to do data analysis
in a more modular, declarative, and functional way. Higher order functions
promote reuse, and, using map and reduce will allow us to easily scale
our data analysis to thousands of computers using MapReduce frameworks like
Hadoop. Also, learning about higher order functions is a great stepping stone
to more complicated functional programming.

---

# Requirements

Know how to define and reference functions in your favorite language.

Python
```python
def inc(a):
  return a + 1

myfn = inc
```

Javascript
```javascript
function inc(a){
  return a + 1;
}

var myfn = inc;
```

Clojure
```clojure
(defn inc [a] (+ 1 a)) ;; Actually, inc is built into Clojure already!
(def myfn inc)
```
---

# What is a higher order function?

A higher order takes functions as arguments and/or returns functions.

Python
```python
def pointless()
  return inc

pointless()(1) #=> 2
```

Javascript
```javascript
function pointless(){
  return inc;
}

pointless()(1); //=> 2
```

Clojure
```clojure
(defn pointless [] inc)
((pointless) 1) ;;=> 2
```
---

#..cont

Python
```python
def pointless2(number_fun):
  return number_fun(1)

pointless2(inc) #=> 2
```

Javascript
```javascript
function pointless(numberFun){
  return numberFun(1);
}

pointless2(inc); //=> 2
```

Clojure
```clojure
(defn pointless2 [number-fun] (number-fun 1))
(pointless2 inc) ;;=> 2
```

# Higher order list functions

There are a class of higher order functions that exist to transform
lists and arrays. These functions abstract the concept of iterating
over a list.

This means that these higher order functions can be used to replace
any iteration method that you might use to access, modify, or 
otherwise consume a list. The most common way of iterating though
a list is to use a for loop.

The three most common functions in this family are `filter`, `map`,
and `reduce`.

---

# Getting these functions

If you're in Python, you're in luck! These functions are built in
to your languge, so you can start using them right now.

`map(...)`

`filter(...)`

`reduce(...)`

If you're in Javascript, you're going to need the help of a library.
Try using Underscore.js or Lodash.js! These two libraries bind
these functions to the variable `_`, so functions calls will
be preceded by this variable.

`_.map(...)`

`_.filter(...)`

`_.reduce(...)`

---

# Filter

Filter is a higher-order function that is used to remove elements from a list.
It does this by taking a function that returns true or false based on whether
an element belongs in the filtered list.

`filter(even, [1,2,3,4,5,6])` => `[2,4,6]`

`filter(greaterThanZero, [-1, 0, 2, 4]` => `[2,4]`

`filter(isString, [1, 2, "hello", 3, 4, 5, "world"])` => `["hello", "world"]`
---

# cont...

Python
```python
def even(n):
  return 0 == (n % 2)

filter(even, [1,2,3,4,5,6]) #=> [2,4,6]
```

Javascript
```javascript
function even(n){
  return 0 == (n % 2);
}

_.filter(even, [1,2,3,4,5,6]) //=> [2,4,6]
```

Clojure
```clojure
(defn even? [n] (zero? (mod n 2))) ;; Already exists in Clojure!
(filter even? [1,2,3,4,5,6]) ;; [2,4,6]
```

---

# Map

Map is a higher order function that uses an function
to transform every element of a list.

`map(inc, [1,2,3])` => `[2,3,4]`

`map(halfString, ["ab", "hello", "world"])` => `["a", "hel", "wor"]`

`map(even, [1,2,3,4])` => `[false, true, false, true]`


```
clients = [{"name":"Sal"},
           {"name":"Jeff"},
           {"name":"Batman"}]

map(name, clients) #=> ["Sal", "Jeff", "Batman"]
```

---

# ...cont

Python:
```python
def name(client):
  return client["name"]

map(name, clients) #=> ["Sal", "Jeff", "Batman"]
```

Javascript
```javascript
def name(client){
  return client.name;
}

map(name, clients) //=> ["Sal", "Jeff", "Batman"]
```

Clojure
```clojure
map(:name, clients) ;;=> ["Sal", "Jeff", "Batman"]
```

# Reduce

Reduce takes a list of things, and uses a function to
combine all of them into something. Functions passed into
reduce need to take two arguements. The first arguement
is the current value of our combination. The second argument
is the next value in the list. Reduce is also the only function
of the three that takes a third argument, an initial value. This
value is the initial value of our combination.

`reduce(add, [1,2,3,4], 0)` => `10`

`reduce(add, [1,2,3,4], 5)`=> `15`

`reduce(concat, ["hel", "lo ", "wor", "ld!"], "")` => "hello world!"

`reduce(multiply, [2,2,2,2], 1)` => `16`

---

#...cont

Python
```python
def add(sum, n):
  return sum + n

reduce(add, [1,2,3,4], 0) #=> 10
```

Javascript
```javascript
function add(sum,n){
  return sum + n;
}

_.reduce(add, [1,2,3,4], 0) #=> 10
```

Clojure
```clojure
(reduce + [1 2 3 4] 0)
```

#Dojo...START!

We work for a very big online sales retail company that just started
selling goods in bitcoin. We need to generate reports on the sales
we have just made. Our bosses, specifically, want to know how many
dollars we've made selling Grace Hopper Coloring Books to young kids,
ages 5-12. Value of sales vary because of the new haggling feature
on your website.

```
[{"age":10, product:"Pterodactyl Coloring Book", "btc":10}
{"age":20, product:"Grace Hopper Coloring Book", "btc":12}
{"age":13, product:"Pterodactyl Coloring Book", "btc":11}
{"age":3, product:"Pterodactyl Coloring Book", "btc":14}
{"age":5, product:"Terrifying Coloring Book", "btc":11}
{"age":7, product:"Terrifying Coloring Book", "btc":9}
{"age":18, product:"Pterodactyl Coloring Book", "btc"8}
{"age":9, product:"Forbidden Coloring Book", "btc":7}
{"age":11, product:"Grace Hopper Coloring Book", "btc":14}

# Additional Challenges!

1. Try coding the reduce function in a language of your choice!

2. Try coding the map and filter functions in terms of reduce!

# Problem 1

```python
def reduce_dojo(reducer, my_list, start):
    if len(my_list) == 0:
        return start;
    else:
        return reduce_dojo(reducer, my_list[1:], reducer(start, my_list[0]))
```

---

# Problem 2

```python
def appender(my_list, next):
    my_list.append(next)
    return my_list

def map_dojo(mapper, my_list):
    reducer = lambda my_list, next: appender(my_list, mapper(next))
    return reduce_dojo(reducer, my_list, [])

def filter_dojo(filterer, my_list):
    reducer = lambda my_list, next: appender(my_list, filterer(next))
    return reduce_dojo(reducer, my_list, [])
