			In Skull Beggar, the streamer opens betting before beginning
			a Binding of Isaac game. Users are allowed to place on bet
			on the enemy they believe will be responsible for the streamer's
			death. The user is also allowed to bet on the streamer winning
			the game. The streamer then must close betting, and play the game
			until they win or lose. If some users guessed correctly, the pot is 
			split evenly between them. If not, bets are returned to the users.
