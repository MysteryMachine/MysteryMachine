    <h1> Modding in Skyrim as Game Design </h1>
    <p>
     Intro
    </p>
    <p>
      When modding, it is easy to start out by addressing minor annoyances.
      You fix problems like, "I can't carry as much as I would like",
      "fast travel feels overpowered", "the leveling system is boring".
      When starting to mod Skyrim, I approached it having used modding
      in that way. Mods are often a way for power users to inject advanced
      features that would lower barriers of entry to beginners, and Skyrim's
      design deviations from the cult-classic Morrowind successfully reduce
      those barriers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing wrong with designing for beginners. I treat difficulty
      in games in much the same way as difficulty in reading. Metaphors might
      be a little complicated for a young reader, but a high schooler should
      do just fine. A college student might be expected to be comfortable
      with an assortment of literary devices that might challenge a high
      school student. Outside of motor difficulties, the only thing stopping
      many folks from enjoying more difficult games is a lack of time and a
      lack of practice. Accessible difficulties and mechanics offer folks
      a way to get that practice. Like writing a novel, you write for different
      audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Game mechanics can offer loads of richness to an experience. Folks that
      are not used to complex games might have trouble balancing loads of
      different mechanical, tactical, and strategical demands. It is also
      common for human beings to seek greater challenges. Avid readers read
      longer novels, music fans might seek music with greater complexity.
      Complexity builds room for nuance. At the end of the day, when I modded
      Skyrim, I did not come out with a different game. I came out with
      a more textured version of the same game, something with more room for
      nuance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another neat similarity is in how one can enjoy complexity within one's
      medium of choice. There are bands that create complex composition for
      the thrill of composing something difficult, and there are people that
      consume that work because they enjoy complexity. There are songs that
      have complex rhythmic structure in order to add to the meaning of the
      song. There are songs that pack a lot of meaning into very simple packages.
      Games are that way too. Some folks like hard games for the sake
      of enjoying a complex thing. Some games use their complexity to make a
      nuanced argument. Some games have very little mechanical complexity,
      but still pack a lot of meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, my goal was to weave a complex series of systems into
      something with thematic unity. Simplicity is often much harder than
      complexity, and I do not think one could ever mod Skyrim into something
      simple and concise, and I would not dare to try. Instead, I offer a
      tapestry. Something that after hours of play, could illustrate an
      emotional picture.
    </p>
    <h2> Theme </h2>
    <p>
      This emotional picture is the theme. I use the word emotion, because I
      did not compile this mod list from a top down perspective. I tweaked,
      and playtested, and sat down, and thought, and repeated. In doing so,
      I think it would be hard not to encode a part of one's self into the
      mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think at the core of my emotional picture is my experiences with
      Elder Scrolls: Morrowind as a kid, and what I as an adult think about
      heroism. My design answers the question,
      <em>"What does it mean to be a hero?"</em>
    </p>
    <h2> Design Goals </h2>
    <p>
      Why is it good to have design goals?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Create interesting decisions
        <ul>
          <li> Eliminate obvious choices and non-choices </li>
          <li> Encourage risk taking, create tradeoffs, interesting consequences </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Immersion synergizes with mechanics
        <ul>
          <li> Mechanics reward immersive behaviors </li>
          <li> Restrict actions via mechanics instead of via roleplay </li>
          <li> Enforce consequences </li>
          <li> Build hills and valleys of tension using mechanics </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitate emergent storytelling
        <ul>
          <li> Create interesting encounters </li>
          <li> Good play supercedes RPG elements </li>
          <li> Game mechanics are about a sense of self, not numbers </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Non-Goals </h2>
    <ul>
      <li> Facilitate variety in roleplay </li>
      <li> Create a challenge for the sake of challenge </li>
      <li> Create a power fantasy </li>
    </ul>
