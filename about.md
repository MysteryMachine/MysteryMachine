I, Sal 'Mystery' Becker am a general programmer, artist, and games maker. By day I build Ruby on Rails API web apps consumed by an Angular JS frontend, as a full-stack developer, and by night I works on game and other programming tidbits.

I like learning new things, and, in my studies, I've gained a love for functional programming paradigms. My current focus is two-fold. Firstly, I'm improving my knowledge of data science and machine learning as a career ambition. Secondarily, I'm focusing on creating games using a functional paradigm, intent on showing the power of side-effectless code on complex game design.

As a gamer, I am a big fan of indie games. I specifically focus on games as a budding art form. Primarily, in my study, I tend to focus on how gameplay, when correctly wielded, can heighten the artistic power of a game. Games I like range from AAA titles like Dark Souls, to independent cult hits like Journey, to roguelikes like Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup and Dwarf Fortress.
